# GOATed Apps
A list of incredible apps I have found over the years that I absolutely recommend to anyone!


Welcome to this repository! I have been a long-term Android and Windows user. During my time of using these operating systems, I have often come across many incredible applications that I still use in my day-to-day life. This repository aims to help and make aware of these amazing apps to everyone who wants something new and useful! Let's start this then, shall we?


## 1. [Stratum] (https://stratumauth.com/) - FOSS

Stratum is an application that I have installed on every android device I have. It's a straightforward, no bullshit and customisable authenticator app that is available on both [Play Store] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stratumauth.app) and on [GitHub] (https://github.com/stratumauth/app/releases/tag/v1.4.0). It's what Google Authenticator, Authy and whatever else should have been, but is not.
